# Mobile App Development Strategy for Admissions Edge

This document outlines suggestions and a strategic approach for developing a mobile application based on the existing "Admissions Edge" web CRM.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Unified Cross-Platform Experience

The new strategy is to migrate the entire "Admissions Edge" application to a single codebase using Flutter. This will create a unified, consistent user experience across all platforms, including iOS, Android, and the web. This approach maximizes development efficiency, simplifies maintenance, and ensures feature parity across all devices.

**Motto:** "One- codebase, every platform."

## 2. Recommended Technology Stack

To achieve a true single-codebase solution, Flutter is the recommended framework.

*   **Primary Recommendation: Flutter**
    *   **Why:** Flutter's single codebase compiles to native ARM code for mobile and to a highly optimized web application (using either HTML or CanvasKit rendering). This eliminates the need to maintain separate web and mobile development teams and ensures that new features are immediately available to all users, regardless of their device. Its rich widget library and control over every pixel allow for a beautiful, brand-consistent UI across all platforms.
    *   **UI/UX:** Leverage Flutter's responsive design capabilities to create a seamless experience that adapts to different screen sizes. Use widgets like `LayoutBuilder`, `MediaQuery`, and packages like `flutter_adaptive_scaffold` to build a UI that feels natural on mobile, tablets, and desktops.
    *   **Navigation:** Implement a robust routing solution using a package like `go_router` to handle deep linking and nested navigation consistently across web and mobile.

## 3. Feature Parity: A Comprehensive Port

The goal is to achieve 100% feature parity with the existing Next.js web application. This involves porting all existing modules and functionalities to the new Flutter application.

### a. Core Modules to Rebuild in Flutter:
*   **User Authentication:** A secure, unified authentication system for all user roles (Super Admin, Marketing Manager, Admission Manager, Finance, Admission Executive) with support for token management and secure storage.
*   **Leads Management:** Recreate both the Kanban board (using drag-and-drop functionality) and the data table views. Ensure filtering, searching, and click-to-action features (like initiating calls or emails) are present.
*   **Campaign Management:** Full campaign creation and management capabilities, including budget allocation and status tracking.
*   **Budget Approvals:** The complete workflow for creating, submitting, and approving/rejecting budget requests.
*   **Accounting:** Full-featured payment record and ad spend management tables.
*   **Call Management:** Both Live Call Monitoring (with listen, whisper, barge capabilities) and a complete Call History with recording playback.
*   **User Management & Settings:** Comprehensive user administration and individual user preference panels.

### b. Mobile-Specific Enhancements:
While aiming for feature parity, the Flutter app should also leverage native mobile capabilities.
*   **Push Notifications:** A critical feature for mobile. Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send real-time alerts for new lead assignments, budget approval requests, and important campaign milestones.
*   **Biometric Authentication:** Implement Face ID or fingerprint login for quick and secure access on mobile devices.
*   **Offline Support:** This is a major advantage of a native mobile app. Use a local database solution like **Drift (Moor)** or **Isar** to cache critical data (leads, user info). Actions taken offline (like adding notes) should be queued and synced with the server once a connection is re-established. This ensures the app remains functional even with intermittent connectivity.

## 4. UX/UI & Design Recommendations

*   **Responsive Design:** Design the UI from a "mobile-first" perspective, then scale it up for tablets and desktops. Components should fluidly reflow and adapt their layout based on screen size.
*   **Platform Adaptability:** While maintaining brand consistency, use adaptive components that can optionally conform to the design language of the underlying platform (e.g., Cupertino for iOS, Material You for Android) where it makes sense for a better native feel.
*   **Performance:** Profile the app on all target platforms to ensure smooth animations and fast load times. Utilize Flutter's performance optimization tools and best practices.

## 5. API & Backend Considerations

*   Your existing API backend can be fully reused, which is a major advantage.
*   The API should remain the single source of truth for all data.
*   The backend will need to be enhanced to support a push notification service (like FCM) to send notifications to the Flutter app.

By adopting this Flutter-centric strategy, you will build a future-proof, scalable, and maintainable application that serves your users everywhere, from a single, efficient codebase.
