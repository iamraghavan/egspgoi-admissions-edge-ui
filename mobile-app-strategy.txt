# Mobile App Development Strategy for Admissions Edge

This document outlines suggestions and a strategic approach for developing a mobile application based on the existing "Admissions Edge" web CRM.

## 1. Core Philosophy: Focused & Action-Oriented

The mobile app should not be a direct port of the entire web application. Instead, it should focus on the on-the-go needs of your users, primarily Admission Executives and Managers. The key is to provide quick access to critical information and enable fast actions.

**Motto:** "Information at a glance, action in a tap."

## 2. Recommended Technology Stack

For the best balance of performance, development speed, and code reusability, a cross-platform framework is highly recommended.

*   **Primary Recommendation: React Native**
    *   **Why:** Your team already has expertise in React (from the Next.js web app). This allows for significant code-sharing of business logic, data-fetching functions, and utility helpers. You can reuse the logic from `src/lib/data.ts` and `src/lib/auth.ts` with minimal changes.
    *   **UI Components:** Use a component library like **React Native Paper** or **Tamagui** to build a high-quality, consistent UI quickly. Tamagui, in particular, has a philosophy similar to ShadCN and works across web and mobile.
    *   **Navigation:** Use **React Navigation** for all routing and screen transitions.

*   **Alternative: Flutter**
    *   **Why:** Excellent performance and a beautiful, highly customizable UI. If native-like performance and UI polish are the absolute top priorities and your team is willing to learn Dart, Flutter is a strong contender.

## 3. Key Features for the Mobile App (MVP)

Focus on the features that are most valuable when users are away from their desks.

### a. Streamlined Authentication
*   **Biometric Login:** Implement fingerprint or Face ID login after the initial password authentication for fast, secure access.
*   **Persistent Sessions:** Use secure token storage (like Keychain for iOS and Keystore for Android) to keep users logged in for longer, with silent token refreshes in the background.

### b. Lead Management (For Admission Executives & Managers)
*   **Simplified Lead List:** A mobile-friendly list view of assigned leads. Key information should be visible upfront: Name, Status, and Last Contacted Date.
*   **"Click-to-Call" and "Click-to-Email":** Tapping a lead's phone number or email should immediately open the native dialer or email client. This is a crucial mobile feature.
*   **Quick Status Updates:** Easily swipe or tap to update a lead's status (e.g., from "New" to "Contacted").
*   **Add Notes:** A simple form to add notes to a lead after a call or meeting. Consider voice-to-text input for hands-free note-taking.
*   **Filtering & Searching:** Basic search by lead name and filtering by status are essential.

### c. Dashboard for Managers
*   A simplified, mobile-first dashboard for Admission Managers and Super Admins.
*   Focus on key performance indicators (KPIs):
    *   New Leads Today/This Week.
    *   Calls Made Today.
    *   Team's Lead Status Overview (simple bar chart).
*   Avoid complex charts; use clear, large numbers and simple visualizations.

### d. Call Management
*   **Call History:** A list of recent calls with the ability to tap to play recordings.
*   **Live Call Monitoring (for Managers):** This is a power-user feature. On mobile, it should be a simple list of active calls. Tapping a call could offer a "Listen" option, but features like "Whisper" and "Barge" may be too complex for an initial mobile release and could be added later.

### e. Push Notifications
This is a mobile-first advantage.
*   **For Admission Executives:**
    *   "New lead assigned to you: [Lead Name]."
    *   Reminders for scheduled follow-ups.
*   **For Managers:**
    *   "Campaign [Campaign Name] has generated [X] new leads."
    *   "Budget request from [User Name] requires your approval."

## 4. UX/UI & Design Recommendations

*   **Navigation:** Use a bottom tab navigator for primary sections (e.g., Leads, Dashboard, Call History, Settings).
*   **Gestures:** Utilize mobile-native gestures. For example, swipe-to-reveal actions on a lead list item (e.g., swipe right to call, swipe left to update status).
*   **Offline Support:** This is critical for mobile. The app should be usable even with a spotty internet connection.
    *   **Strategy:** Cache essential data locally (leads, user info). Queue actions like note creation or status updates and sync them with the server once the connection is restored. A library like **WatermelonDB** or **Realm** can handle this complex state management.
*   **Readability:** Use the established brand fonts ('Inter' and 'Space Grotesk'), but ensure font sizes and contrast ratios are optimized for smaller screens and varied lighting conditions.
*   **Component Design:** Use card-based layouts for lists to clearly separate items. Ensure all buttons and touch targets are large enough for easy tapping.

## 5. What to Exclude from the Initial Mobile App

To keep the MVP focused and achievable, some features from the web app should be deferred:

*   **Complex Creation/Editing:** Full campaign creation, user management, and budget request forms are better suited for the desktop experience. The mobile app can provide links or deep-links to the web app for these tasks.
*   **Printing & PDF Generation:** This is not a primary mobile use case.
*   **Advanced Filtering/Reporting:** The detailed data tables with complex date-range filtering and column customization should remain on the web app. Mobile filtering should be simple and essential.
*   **Kanban Board:** While possible, a full-featured drag-and-drop Kanban board can be difficult to use on a small screen. A prioritized list view is often more effective for mobile. It could be added in a later version with a landscape view.

## 6. API & Backend Considerations

*   Your existing API can be largely reused, which is a major advantage.
*   Ensure the API authentication is robust and supports mobile-friendly token refresh mechanisms.
*   Implement a dedicated push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging - FCM) on your backend to send notifications to the mobile app.

By following this strategy, you can build a highly effective mobile app that complements your powerful web CRM and provides significant value to your users on the move.
